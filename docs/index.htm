<h2 cbc>What is AI?</h2>
<p>There is no exact definition of AI, but there are two main attributes: Adaptive and autonomous. On the contraty, traditionally programmed algorithms are non-adaptive, they produce the same result for each run with the same input. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>adaptive behavior in dynamic environments</li>
<li>finding optima in a complex environment</li>
<li>pattern recognition</li>
<li>computer vision</li>
<li>autonomous driving</li>
<li>non-trivial curve fitting</li>
<li>recommendation or prediction based on historical data</li>
<li>transformation of data in order to match predefined patterns or statistics (image processing filters)</li>
<li>autonomous in complex and/or dynamic environment</li>
<li>traditional algorithmic problem solving would be prohibitively complex</li>
</ul>

<p>There are other keywords associated with AI:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Machine learning</dt>
<dd>A part of AI. Improves behavior based on experience (previous input and output data evauated against target criteria)</dd>

<dt>Deep learning</dt>
<dd>A part of machine learning. Iterative refinement of already complex mathematical models. Requires enormous computational resources. </dd>

<dt>Data Science</dt>
<dd>Integrates parts from information technology, artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning, as well as statistics, economics, law and other areas. Therefore data science  is usually not considered part of information technology.</dd>

<dt>Robotics</dt>
<dd>The art of building machines that function well in complex real scenarios.</dd>
